## 📍 Roadmap Overview

Each section focuses on one core aspect of Agentic AI, progressing from basic concepts to real working examples.

### Week 1: Foundations
- `01_introduction/what_is_agentic_ai.md`  
  → What is Agentic AI? Why does it matter?
- `02_llms_foundation/openai_basics.md`  
  → How Large Language Models (LLMs) work — prompts, completions, temperature, etc.  
  → Simple OpenAI API demo

### Week 2: Agent Planning
- `03_planning_agents/react_vs_plan_and_execute.md`  
  → ReAct vs Plan-and-Execute strategies  
  → Diagrams, pros & cons
- `04_langchain/tool_use_demo.ipynb`  
  → ReAct agent using LangChain + OpenAI

### Week 3: Tool Use & Memory
- `05_tool_execution/calculator_agent.py`  
  → Python function-based tool calling with LangChain
- `06_memory/memory_in_agents.md`  
  → How agents remember things  
  → ConversationBufferMemory + Colab notebook

### Week 4: Case Study & Polish
