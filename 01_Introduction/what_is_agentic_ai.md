# 🧠 What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is the idea of giving AI systems more *autonomy* — not just responding to one prompt at a time, but actively deciding **what to do next**, how to **plan**, **use tools**, and even **collaborate** with other agents to solve problems.

## 🤔 Okay... but what does that mean?

Most AI models today (like ChatGPT) respond to a prompt and stop. They don’t remember past steps. They don’t ask themselves, “What should I do next?” or “Should I search something before I answer?”

Agentic AI flips that. It turns large language models (LLMs) into **problem solvers with initiative**.

## 🛠️ What Makes an AI 'Agentic'?

An *agentic* AI has:

- **A goal** – like “book a flight” or “summarize this folder of documents”
- **A plan** – breaking the goal into steps
- **Tool use** – like calculators, web search, file readers, databases
- **Memory** – to remember previous steps or conversations
- **Self-reflection** – sometimes asking itself “did that work?”

Basically: it’s like giving ChatGPT a brain, a to-do list, and a toolbox.

## 💡 Why Does Agentic AI Matter?

Because it's how we move from “just chatbots” to real-world AI assistants that can:

- Automate research
- Code entire apps
- Manage your calendar
- Plan trips
- Summarize meetings
- Coordinate with other agents

It’s a stepping stone toward **autonomous agents** — not just smart responders, but smart decision-makers.
