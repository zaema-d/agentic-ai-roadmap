# 🧠 Agentic AI Roadmap – A Step-by-Step Self-Learning Guide

Welcome to my personal learning journey into **Agentic AI** — the future of LLM applications.

This is a **free, beginner-friendly guide** for anyone (including me!) who wants to go from zero to building their own AI agents — using **open tools**, **free resources**, and a lot of curiosity.

---

## 🚀 Why This Exists

I currently work in QA automation, but I've always been fascinated by how AI can move beyond chatbots — into autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and act.

Since I couldn’t find a structured roadmap that started *simple* and stayed *free*, I made one.

This repo documents my hands-on learning, and if you’re curious about Agentic AI, feel free to follow along or fork it to build your own learning stack.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

✅ What Agentic AI really means (in plain English)  
✅ How LLMs can plan, call tools, and remember things  
✅ How to build and run agents using LangChain + OpenAI  
✅ How frameworks like ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, and LangGraph work  
✅ How to structure multi-agent workflows  
✅ How to evaluate agents responsibly
